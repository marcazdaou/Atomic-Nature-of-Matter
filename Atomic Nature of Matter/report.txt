4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Particle Representation)
      Approach: I defined Blob b ( already given by the instructor), then I defined add by following the directions.
      I incremented pixels by 1 after adding x and y. I defined mass and returned pixels as suggested by the API.
      I used euclidean distance formula after I define distance to return the distance between blob b and blob c.
      Lastly i defined string and returned the value pixel, x and y as a string representation.

      Issues and resolution: this problem was straight forward, I did not face any issues or problem.

   Problem 2 (Particle Identification)
      Approach: I set blob as an empty list. Created a 2D list called marked, having the same dimensions as pic.
   then I created a Blob object called blob; called _findBlob() with the appropriate arguments,
   and then I added blob to blobs if it has a non-zero mass. I defined getBeads, and set a as an empty list.
   I set b as len of self._blob. Then if mass of the blob is greater than or equal to pixels,
   I added self._blobs to variable "a". Defined findBlob, I used the base case that was stated in the directions.
   Marked the pixel (i, j). Marked pixel True if luminance is less than tau. I added the pixel to blob.
   I Recursively called _findBlob() on the N, E, W, and S pixels.

      Issues and resolution: At first I was doing fine with this problem, but after I got on defining getBead,
      I got stuck for a while, I did not know what to do, so I went back to the slide show presentation and watched
      a video about what we did in class, and then I figured it out. The rest of the problem needed some thinking,
      but I managed to get through it.

   Problem 3 (Particle Tracking)
      Approach: Accept command-line arguments pixels (int),tau (float), delta (float). For this problem I did not use
      import math because I found another approach for it. I constructed BlobFinder object from fame sys.argv[4]
       and got a list of beads named prevBeads.Then I set prevBeads to currBeads. For each bead currBead in currBeads,
        I found a bead prevBead from prevBeads that is no further than delta and is closest to currBead.
        I wrote the distance using the formula. Wrote a new line character.

      Issues and resolution: I think I had an easier and simpler approach to this problem.
       I did not face any issue or problems. I showed my code to the teaching assistance
       he told me that it would work fine.

   Problem 4 (Data Analysis)
      Approach: Initialize ETA, RHO, T, and R to appropriate values ( based on the directions and the paragraph).
      Set displacement to standard input. Calculated the var as the sum of the squares of the n displacements
      (each converted from pixels to meters) read from standard input(given by the directions). I used both the map and
      lambda function to create a new list. I then divided var by 2 * n.
      Used the formula given for Boltzmann and Avogadro's constant.
      Wrote to standard output the two constants in scientific notation  separated by a space.


      Issues and resolution: I did not face any issues or problem.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I am learning a lot while doing these types of projects, even though they are taking a lot of time. I am happy with
   my results so far in this course. I am trying my hardest to learn and go over the material we studied in class.
   I am definitely enjoying these projects.
